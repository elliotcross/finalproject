          <p>My name is Elliot Cross. I'm in my twenties, living in the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S. after decades of living all over the states and in a few countries overseas. I am studying web design at Bellevue College in Bellevue, Washington. I also work full time doing home appliance repair. And, I am a musician.</p>
          <h2>Studies</h2>
        <p>I've been taking classes in business, marketing, and web design at Bellevue College for two years. I've already had an introduction to HTML and CSS. This semester I am taking a class that covers JavaScript in addition to HTML and CSS. Ultimately I hope to put what I am learning in business, marketing, and website design to work running my own record label and promoting my own band.</p>

       <h2>Music</h2>

          <p>I am a guitarist and drummer, and I write music. I've been performing with bands in locations from Phoenix, Arizona to Bellingham, Washington for ten years. My current band, Triacs, based out of Bellingham, Washington, is a progressive and psychedelic rock band. I also have a recording studio located in Bellingham, where I record and produce music for my start-up independent record label, Floss Records.</p>
          <h2>Work</h2>

          <p>Besides working on school and music, I spend a lot of time at my job. I work doing mechanical repairs, tooling around western Washington State from Vancouver to Blaine in my repair van. I go out on assignment for a large national home appliance repair company. It's a lot of time on the road, but it keeps the roof over my head!</p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/GHTOOc7BhSAzg2nRCx/giphy.gif" alt="Cartoon animation van"><br><br><br><br><br>
