			<h2>Music, Music, Music</h2>
			<p>In my free time, I'm a musician, songwriter, and entrepreneur. I play guitar, drums, vocals, bass, keyboards and piano.  I like a wide range of musical styles including jazz, metal, progressive and classical. 
				I'm currently lead guitarist and singer for the band Triacs. I'm also the songwriter. Triacs is a progressive rock band, with jazz, metal, and psychedelic rock influences.
				I also founded the record label Floss Records. From a recording studio in Bellingham, Washington, Floss Records provides recording and production services for Pacific Northwest artists.
				I've been performing and recording my original music since 2010, both solo and ensemble. My goal is to continue to create my own music and to expand the Floss Records label and music production business.</p>
